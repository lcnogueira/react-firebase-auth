# react-firebase-auth

A simple boilerplate that I have created while studying firebase API. It shows how to:

- Sign in, sign up and sign out a user by using the firebase console API;
- Share the logged in user information through the component tree by using the Context API and the `useContext` hook;
- How to create private routes based on the context information.

## How to test

1. Clone this project;
2. Create a firebase project and fill the data in the `.env.example` file;
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`;
4. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`;
5. Start the project: `yarn start`.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
